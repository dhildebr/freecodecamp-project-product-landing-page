            I'm an adventurer, which means the good people of Gielinor point me towards someone who deserves it and I leave a trail of corpses between here and there. To earn any money in this trade, you learn to strip everything you kill of anything sufficiently light or valuable, to sell when you get back to town. With the partitioned bag of holding, I can haul about the half dozen swords and axes I inexlicably found in a dragon's belly and not worry about losing that enchanted ring I found among the clutter.

            I'm what you could call a power-user. Before the partitioned bag, everything went in one or a handful of sacks and pouches. My runestones tumbled among my scrolls, my scrolls went crashing into my potions, my potions spilled all over my journals &ndash; and a foul black slurry pooled beneath it all. Now everything is segregated into one of potentially numerous demiplanes. This sets a new standard for pocket dimension storage solutions!

            When at last I return to civilisation, I'm always hauling a truly ludricrous number of fresh pelts into town. Before the partitioned bag of holding, I was limited by how high I could stack it all on my back, but now I'm limited only by my own strength. As a side benefit, I can stop getting the stink-eye from innkeeps for bringing a cloud of animal musk and a trail of blood in the door.
